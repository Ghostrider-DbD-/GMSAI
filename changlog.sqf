Build 33 May 11 2024 
scripts to spawn patrols redone using try/catch structures.

Change method for road patrols so they go from location to location 
Assume that if the driver is configed correctly he will follow roads 
I will allow GMSCore to ensure the driver is setup that way 

Build 32 October 2 2023 
Fixed an error in _spawnVehiclePatrols (GMSA_alertDistanceByDifficulty was incorrectly spelled)

Build 30 September 22 2023
Fixed an issue with tracking and reporting the number of UGVs that were spawned.
Ensured there is a logged entry each time a unit or vehicle is spawned.
